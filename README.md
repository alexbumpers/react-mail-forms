# react-mail-forms | about
react-mail-forms is a simple, elegant, ready-made tool for implementing email/contact forms on React sites using Nodemailer. No need for a heavy email service: just simply plug in your email information, and the input from the form will be sent to the email that you give.

Currently in its infancy, react-email-forms currently serves as a simple boilerplate contact form, with email functionality coming soon.

## react-mail-forms | getting started

Simply fork and clone the repo and get started with the boilerplate in `App.js`. Requires up-to-date version of Ant Design, which can be installed with `npm install -g antd`.
